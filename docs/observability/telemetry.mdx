The telemetry sharing functionality in the BeeAI platform collects metrics and operational data. This helps us understand how the platform performs in real-world environments. Telemetry sharing is **enabled** by default and helps us:

- Identify performance bottlenecks.
- Improve platform stability and reliability.
- Enhance user experience by understanding usage patterns.

## Data Collected

We value your privacy and ensure that **no sensitive data** is collected through telemetry sharing. The following types of information are gathered:

- Platform version and runtime environment details.
- Anonymized usage statistics for built-in features.

## Disabling Telemetry Sharing

We understand that not all users want to send telemetry data. You can easily disable this feature when starting the platform with:

```sh
beeai platform start --no-telemetry-sharing
```
