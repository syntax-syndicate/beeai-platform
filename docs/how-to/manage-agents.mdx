BeeAI provides multiple ways to work with agents in your local environment. This guide explains how to import new agents, update existing ones, and remove agents when they're no longer needed.

## Finding Available Agents

Before adding an agent, you may want to explore what's available:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web UI">

Navigate to the **Agents** tab in the web interface to see a list of all available agents in the official registry. Each agent has a description and installation status.

</Tab>
<Tab title="CLI">

List all available agents with the `list` command:

```bash
beeai list
```

This will show all registered agents with their status, description, and other metadata.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Adding Agents

BeeAI offers multiple methods to add agents to your environment:

### Magic Discovery (Auto-Import)

When developing agents locally with ACP, BeeAI automatically discovers them without manual setup.

```bash
# Example: Run an ACP agent on port 8000
uv run my_agent.py

# The agent automatically appears in BeeAI
beeai list  # Your agent will be visible here
```

The agent automatically appears in both the web UI and when running `beeai list`.

### Installing Registry Agents

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web UI">

In the **Agents** tab:
1. Find the agent you want to install
2. Click the **Install** button (cloud icon) next to its name
3. Wait for the installation to complete (progress will be displayed)

</Tab>
<Tab title="CLI">

Use the `install` command followed by the agent name:

```bash
beeai install chat
```

This will download and set up the specified agent from the official registry.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Adding Docker Images

You can add agents from pre-built Docker images:

```bash
# Add from an image ID
beeai add ghcr.io/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/community/aider:latest
```

### Adding from GitHub

Import agents directly from GitHub repositories:

```bash
# Basic import
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/custom-agent"

# With version specification
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/custom-agent@v1.0.0"

# From specific subdirectory
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/custom-agent#path=/agents/my-agent"

# Combined version and path
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/custom-agent@main#path=/agents/my-agent"
```

<Info>
  GitHub repositories must contain a `Dockerfile` in the specified path for successful import.
</Info>

### Building and Adding Local Agents

For local development, you can build and add agents from your filesystem:

```bash
# Build an agent from a local directory
beeai build /path/to/agent

# The agent will be available in your agent list
beeai list
```

## Removing Agents

When you no longer need an agent, you can remove it:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web UI">

1. Navigate to the **Agents** tab
2. Find the agent you want to remove
3. Click the **Remove** button next to its name
4. Confirm the removal in the dialog

</Tab>
<Tab title="CLI">

Use the `remove` command:

```bash
beeai remove <agent-name>
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  Removing an agent deletes its Docker image from your system. If you remove a locally built agent, 
  you'll need to rebuild it with `beeai build /path/to/agent` to add it again.
</Warning>

## Checking Agent Status

You can check the status of your agents at any time:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web UI">

The status of each **Agent** is shown in the agent list:
- **Ready**: Not icon is shown. The agent is installed and ready to use.
- **Not Installed**: A download icon is displayed. The agent is available but not yet installed.

</Tab>
<Tab title="CLI">

```bash
# List all agents with status
beeai list
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Viewing Agent Logs

For troubleshooting or debugging, you can view the logs of any agent:

```bash
beeai logs <agent-name>
```

This command shows the agent's logs and continues streaming new logs as they are generated.

## Environment Configuration

Many agents require environment variables for configuration:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web UI">

1. Navigate to the **Settings** tab
2. Go to the **Variables** section
3. Add, edit, or remove environment variables as needed

</Tab>
<Tab title="CLI">

Add or update environment variables:

```bash
beeai env add LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o
beeai env add LLM_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

List current environment variables:

```bash
beeai env list
```

Remove environment variables:

```bash
beeai env remove LLM_API_KEY
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  Common environment variables include `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_API_BASE`, and `LLM_API_KEY` for 
  configuring LLM access.
