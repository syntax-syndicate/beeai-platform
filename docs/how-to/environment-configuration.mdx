Most agents require access to language models and other external services to function. BeeAI makes it easy to configure these connections once and share them across all your agents.

## Quickstart Interactive Setup

The fastest way to get started is with the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
beeai env setup
```

The setup wizard will then guide you through:
- API Key entry (with validation)
- Model selection (with recommendations)
- Connection testing (to verify everything works)
- Provider-specific options (like context window for Ollama)

## Supported LLM Providers

BeeAI supports a wide range of language model providers:

### Cloud Providers
- Anthropic Claude
- Cerebras - has a free tier
- Chutes - has a free tier
- Cohere - has a free tier
- DeepSeek
- Google Gemini - has a free tier
- Groq - has a free tier
- IBM watsonx
- Mistral - has a free tier
- NVIDIA NIM
- OpenAI
- OpenRouter - has some free models
- Perplexity
- together.ai - has a free tier

### Local Providers
- **Ollama**
- **Jan**

### Custom Providers via LLM Gateway

If you have a custom OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, you can configure it during the interactive setup via `beeai env setup` by selecting "Other (RITS, vLLM, ...)" and providing your API URL.

BeeAI includes a built-in LLM gateway that provides a unified OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. This is useful when you want to:
- Point existing agents to BeeAI instead of directly to LLM providers
- Centrally manage API keys and provider configurations
- Switch providers without reconfiguring individual agents

After configuring BeeAI with a provider, the gateway is available at: http://localhost:8333/api/v1/llm/chat/completions

<Note>
This is a POST-only API endpoint for programmatic use. Use curl or OpenAI-compatible clients to interact with it.
</Note>

The gateway automatically handles:
- Authentication with your configured provider
- Provider-specific request/response formatting
- Both streaming and non-streaming responses
- Request validation and error responses

<Important>
The gateway uses whatever LLM provider you've configured with `beeai env setup`. Configure your preferred provider first, then use the gateway endpoint in your applications.

## Agent-Specific Variables

Some agents require additional API keys for external services.

Example variables that agents might declare:

```bash
# Search APIs
beeai env add TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-key
beeai env add SERP_API_KEY=your-serpapi-key

# Third-party services
beeai env add GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
beeai env add DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
```

<Important>
Agents can only access environment variables they explicitly declare. You can store any variables with `beeai env add`, but agents will only receive the ones they're configured to use.
Use `beeai agent info <agent-name>` to see exactly what variables each agent needs.
</Important>

## Manual Environment Management

### Add Variables

Set individual variables:
```bash
beeai env add LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o
beeai env add LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
beeai env add LLM_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
```

### View Current Configuration

List all configured environment variables:
```bash
beeai env list
```

### Remove Variables

Remove specific variables:
```bash
beeai env remove LLM_API_KEY
beeai env remove LLM_MODEL LLM_API_BASE
```
