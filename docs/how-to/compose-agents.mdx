Agent composition allows you to chain multiple specialized agents together into powerful workflows, enhancing their capabilities and enabling complex task execution.

By default, each agent receives the output from the previous agent as input. You can customize this behavior in the instructions by specifying how each agent should use the previous outputs.

## GUI

The compose playground provides a visual interface for creating and running multi-agent compositions. Today, we have sequential composition which is powered by the `sequential-workflow` agent.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Launch the web interface">
        ```sh
        beeai playground
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Compose agents">
        - Add agents to your workflow by selecting them from the available list.
        - Arrange them in the desired execution order.
        - For each agent, specify the instructions that describe what it should do.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run your workflow">
        Click the **Run** button to execute the composition.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## CLI

You can also compose agents directly from your terminal using the `sequential-workflow` agent, which orchestrates the execution of multiple agents in sequence.

There are two ways to work within the CLI:

### Interactive mode

Interactive mode walks you through the process of creating a composition step by step:

```sh
beeai run sequential_workflow
```

The CLI will guide you through:
1. Selecting the first agent to run
2. Providing instructions for that agent
3. Choosing whether to add another agent to the sequence
4. Repeating steps 1-3 until your workflow is complete
