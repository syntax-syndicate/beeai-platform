The beeai-platform comes with a few agents out of the box. However, extending the agent library is an easy task,
here are a few ways how you can add new agents.


### Import by magic 🪄
When developing agents locally with ACP, all you need to do is to run the ACP server as you normally would, and your
agents should seamlessly pop up in the platform! You should see them both in the UI and `beeai list` and be able to
work with them the way you're used to in the platform.

This is the simplest, most straightforward way to use your local agents in the platform and should be your go-to option
for local development.

For example, write your agent code in `hello.py`

```python hello.py
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "acp-sdk>=0.8.1",
# ]
# ///

import asyncio
from collections.abc import AsyncGenerator

from acp_sdk.models import Message, Metadata
from acp_sdk.server import Context, RunYield, RunYieldResume, Server

server = Server()

@server.agent(metadata=Metadata(ui={"type": "chat"}))
async def echo(
    input: list[Message], context: Context
) -> AsyncGenerator[RunYield, RunYieldResume]:
    """Echoes everything"""
    for message in input:
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        yield {"thought": "I should echo everything"}
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        yield message

server.run()
```

Once started with `uv run hello.py` you should see the agent automagically in the platform after running `beeai list`.

### Import docker image
You can also add agents using a pre-built docker image. This can be a public image from the internet or one that you
have built locally using `beeai build /path/to/agent`.

Importing docker agents is as simple as
```sh
beeai add <IMAGE-ID>
```


### Import GitHub repository
Another way to add agents is to use source code in a public GitHub repository. All you have to do is run:
```
beeai add "https://github.com/<org>/<repo>"
```
This will download the agent code, build its docker image locally and register it to the platform.

<Tip>
    You can pin the version or specify a subdirectory using the following URL segments:
    - `@<version>` - specify branch or tag
    - `#path=</sub/directory>` - specify agent folder

    For example:
    ```sh
    beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform@release-v0.1.0#path=agents/official/beeai-framework/chat"
    ```
</Tip>

<Warning>
    The repository must contain a `Dockerfile`, see [Share Agents](/how-to/share-agents) section to learn how to publish
    agents to GitHub to make them shareable.
</Warning>


### Removing agents

To remove an agent use
```
beeai remove <agent-name>
```
This will remove agent docker image from your system. If you remove a locally built agent, you'll need to re-run
`beeai build /path/to/agent` if you want to add it again.
