The BeeAI Platform command-line interface (CLI) provides powerful tools to manage, run, and compose agents directly from your terminal. This document serves as a comprehensive reference for all available commands and options.

## Basic Usage

The basic syntax for BeeAI commands follows this pattern:

```bash
beeai [command] [subcommand] [arguments] [options]
```

To see a list of all available commands:

```bash
beeai --help
```

## Core Commands

### Run

Run an agent with specified input:

```bash
beeai run <agent-name> [input]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Run chat agent interactively
beeai run chat

# Run agent with direct input
beeai run chat "Hello!"

# Run agent with input from file
cat input.txt | beeai run chat
```

### List

List all available agents:

```bash
beeai list
```

This displays a table with agent names, statuses, descriptions, and other metadata.

### Info

Get detailed information about a specific agent:

```bash
beeai info <agent-name>
```

Shows details including description, input/output schemas, examples, and configuration options.

### Install / Add

Add an agent to your environment:

```bash
beeai install <agent-name>
# or
beeai add <agent-name>
```

You can also add agents from Docker images or GitHub repositories:

```bash
# Add from Docker image
beeai add ghcr.io/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/community/aider:latest

# Add from GitHub
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/custom-agent"
```

### Remove / Uninstall

Remove an agent from your environment:

```bash
beeai remove <agent-name>
# or
beeai uninstall <agent-name>
```

### Logs

View and follow the logs for an agent:

```bash
beeai logs <agent-name>
```

This displays the agent's log output and continues streaming new logs as they are generated.

### Build

Build an agent from a local directory:

```bash
beeai build /path/to/agent
```

**Options:**
- `--tag=<name>`: Specify a custom tag for the built image
- `--multi-platform`: Build for multiple platforms (slower but more compatible)

### Compose

Compose multiple agents into a workflow:

```bash
beeai compose sequential
```

This launches an interactive interface to create a sequential workflow by connecting multiple agents.

## Environment Management

### Environment Setup

Interactive setup for LLM provider environment variables:

```bash
beeai env setup
```

This guides you through setting up the required environment variables for your chosen LLM provider.

### Environment Variables

Manage environment variables for agents:

```bash
# List all environment variables
beeai env list

# Add or update an environment variable
beeai env add KEY=VALUE

# Remove an environment variable
beeai env remove KEY
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Set up an OpenAI-compatible API
beeai env add LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o
beeai env add LLM_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
beeai env add LLM_API_KEY=sk_...
```

## System Commands

### UI

Launch the web interface:

```bash
beeai ui
```

This starts the BeeAI server (if not already running) and opens the web interface in your default browser.

### Serve

Start the BeeAI server:

```bash
beeai serve
```

This runs the server in the foreground.

### Version

Display version information:

```bash
beeai version
```

## Telemetry Management

Control telemetry data sharing:

```bash
# View telemetry status
beeai telemetry sharing

# Disable telemetry sharing
beeai telemetry sharing --disable
```

## Support Options

Most commands support these general options:

- `--help`: Show help information for a command
- `--debug`: Enable debug output for troubleshooting
