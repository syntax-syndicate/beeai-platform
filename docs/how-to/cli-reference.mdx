BeeAI command-line interface (CLI) provides powerful tools to discover, run, and manage agents directly from your terminal. This document serves as a comprehensive reference for all available commands and options.

## Basic Usage

The basic syntax for BeeAI commands follows this pattern:

```bash
beeai [command] [subcommand] [arguments] [options]
```

To see a list of all available commands:

```bash
beeai --help
```

## Core Commands

### List

List all available agents:

```bash
beeai list
```

This displays a table with agent names, statuses, descriptions, UI types, locations, missing environment variables, and error messages.

### Run

Run an agent with specified input:

```bash
beeai run <agent-name> [input]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Run chat agent interactively
beeai run chat

# Run agent with direct input
beeai run chat "Hello!"

# Run agent with input from file
beeai run chat < input.txt

# Pipe between agents
beeai run gpt-researcher "Latest AI developments" | beeai run chat "Summarize in 3 points"
```

### Info

Get detailed information about a specific agent:

```bash
beeai info <agent-name>
```

Shows details including description, input/output schemas, examples, configuration options, and provider information.

### Add

Add an agent to your environment:

```bash
beeai add <location>
# Aliases: install
```

Use `beeai add` when:
- You want to use an agent (one-step process)
- You don't care about build details
- You want the simplest workflow

Location formats:

```bash
# From Docker image
beeai add ghcr.io/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/community/aider:latest

# From GitHub repository
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/custom-agent"

# From GitHub with version
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/custom-agent#v1.0.0"

# From GitHub with specific path
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/repo#:agents/my-agent"

# From local path (builds Docker image)
beeai add ./my-agent-directory
```

### Remove

Remove an agent from your environment:

```bash
beeai remove <agent-name>
# Aliases: uninstall, rm, delete
```

### Logs

View and follow the logs for an agent:

```bash
beeai logs <agent-name>
```

This displays the agent's log output and continues streaming new logs as they are generated.

### Build

Build an agent from a local directory or repository:

```bash
beeai build [context]
```

Arguments:
- `context`: Docker context for the agent (default: current directory)

Options:
- `--tag <name>`: Docker tag for the agent
- `--multi-platform`: Build for multiple platforms
- `--import / --no-import`: Import the image into BeeAI platform (default: true)

Use `beeai build` when:
- You want to test builds before using them (`--no-import`)
- You need custom build options (`--multi-platform`, custom `--tag`)
- You're developing and want to control the build process
- You want to build images for sharing (not immediate use)

Examples:

```bash
# Build from current directory
beeai build .

# Build with custom tag
beeai build . --tag my-agent:latest

# Build without importing
beeai build . --no-import

# Build from GitHub URL
beeai build "https://github.com/user/repo"
```

## Environment Management

### Environment Setup

Interactive setup for LLM provider environment variables:

```bash
beeai env setup
```

This guides you through setting up the required environment variables for your chosen LLM provider.

### Environment Variables

Manage environment variables for agents:

```bash
# List all environment variables
beeai env list

# Add or update an environment variable
beeai env add KEY=VALUE

# Remove an environment variable
beeai env remove KEY
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Set up an OpenAI-compatible API
beeai env add LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o
beeai env add LLM_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
beeai env add LLM_API_KEY=sk_...
```

## System Commands

### Start

Start the BeeAI server:

```bash
beeai platform start
```

### Stop

Stop the BeeAI server:

```bash
beeai platform stop
```

### Delete

Delete the BeeAI server:

```bash
beeai platform delete
```

### UI

Launch the web interface:

```bash
beeai ui
```

This runs the server in the foreground.

### Version

Display version information:

```bash
beeai version
```

Shows versions of:
- `beeai-cli`
- `beeai-server`
- `acp-sdk`

## Global Options

Most commands support these general options:
- `--help`: Show help information for a command
- `--debug`: Enable debug output for troubleshooting
