This guide shows you how to wrap existing agents from any framework to work with the BeeAI Platform. You'll learn to use the ACP SDK to create a standardized interface for your agent.

<Tip>
If you're building new agents from scratch, check out the [BeeAI Framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework) with its [native platform integration](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework/blob/main/python/docs/integrations.md#beeai-platform-integration).
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

- [BeeAI Platform](/introduction/quickstart) installed
- Python 3.11 or higher
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Your existing agent code ready to integrate

## Quickstart

### Set Up Your Project

Use the [official starter template](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform-agent-starter) to get started quickly.

**Option A** – Clone directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform-agent-starter my-agent
cd my-agent
```

**Option B** – Use as a GitHub template:

1. Go to [the template repository](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform-agent-starter)
2. Click "Use this template" → "Create a new repository"
3. Clone your new repository locally

### Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### Test the Template Agent

```bash
uv run server  # start the server
```

Then in another terminal:

```bash
beeai run example_agent "Alice"
```

You should see: "Ciao Alice!" 🎉

Now let's customize this template.

## Project Structure

```bash
my-agent/
├── src/beeai_agents/
│   ├── __init__.py         # Empty package file
│   └── agent.py            # 👈 Your agent code goes here
├── Dockerfile              # Container configuration
├── pyproject.toml          # Dependencies and metadata
├── uv.lock                 # Dependency lock file
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

**Important files:**
- `agent.py` - Where you implement your agent's behavior
- `pyproject.toml` - Add new Python dependencies here

## Build Your Custom Agent

### Implement Your Agent Logic

Navigate to [src/beeai_agents/agent.py](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform-agent-starter/blob/main/src/beeai_agents/agent.py) and replace the example with your agent implementation.

**Tips for Wrapping Agents:**
- The function name becomes the agent ID (override with `name=`)
- The docstring becomes the description
- Use `input[-1]` to get the latest user message
- Send output with `yield MessagePart(content="...")`
- Multiple agents? Just add more decorated functions.

<Tip>
Each `@server.agent` function defines a new agent service.
</Tip>

Here are examples of wrapping popular agent frameworks:

1. [Example: BeeAI Framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/blob/main/examples/python/beeai-chat/agent.py)
2. [Example: CrewAI](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/blob/main/examples/python/crewai-song-writer/agent.py)
3. [Example: LangGraph](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/blob/main/examples/python/langgraph-greeting/agent.py)

### Configure Agent Metadata

The more metadata, the better the UX. Here's a full example with every supported option:

```python
@server.agent(
    name="my-custom-agent",
    description="A full-featured BeeAI agent with metadata and documentation",
    metadata=Metadata(
        version="1.0.0",
        framework="BeeAI",
        programming_language="Python",
        license="Apache 2.0",
        ui={
            "type": "hands-off",
            "user_greeting": "How can I help you process your data today?"
        },
        author={
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "john.doe@example.com",
            "url": "https://johndoe.dev"
        },
        env=[{
            "name": "API_KEY",
            "description": "Required API key for external service integration",
            "required": True
        }],
        recommended_models=[
            "gpt-4o",
            "gpt-4-turbo",
            "claude-3-sonnet"
        ],
        use_cases=[
            "**Data Analysis** – Process structured/unstructured data",
            "**Report Generation** – Produce clean summaries and insights",
            "**Content Summarization** – Shorten long articles or documents"
        ],
        tags=["data-processing", "analysis", "automation", "nlp", "research"],
        documentation="""
### My Custom Agent

This agent provides robust data processing with smart insights powered by AI.

#### Features
- Automatic data type detection
- Multi-format support (CSV, JSON, XML)
- AI-driven summarization and recommendation

#### How It Works
1. Analyze input
2. Process with AI
3. Return structured output

#### Input Formats
- Text
- Structured files
- Environment-specified parameters

#### Output
- JSON with insights, key findings, and confidence scores
"""
    )
)
async def my_custom_agent(...):
    ...

```

**Agent Types:**
- `"hands-off"`: One-shot tasks (summarization, analysis, generation)
- `"chat"`: Conversational interactions

### Update Dependencies

Add your agent's dependencies to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
dependencies = [
    "acp-sdk>=0.8.1",
    "requests>=2.31.0",     # Add your dependencies here
    "crewai >= 0.30.0"      # For example, CrewAI
]
```

Then synchronize with `uv sync`.

## Test Your Agent

### Start the Agent Server

```bash
uv run server
```

This launches your agent locally. Keep this terminal open - your agent runs only while this command is active.

### Try it with BeeAI

Open a second terminal and run these commands:

```bash
# See all available agents (yours should show up)
beeai list

# Talk to your agent!
beeai run my_agent "Hello!"
```

If you see a response, congrats - your agent is working!

## Deploy Your Agent

Now that your agent works locally, you have two deployment options:

### Option 1: Quick Local Development (Easiest)

Perfect if you're developing and testing locally:

```bash
beeai add .
```

What this does:
- Builds your agent into a Docker container automatically
- Adds it directly to your local BeeAI Platform
- You can immediately use `beeai run my_agent "test"`

When to use this:
- Quick prototyping and testing
- Local development
- You don't need to share the agent with others

### Option 2: Production Deployment (Sharing & CI/CD)

Use this when you want to share your agent or deploy through CI/CD:

**Step 1: Build the Container**

```bash
beeai build . --tag my-agent:1.0.0 --no-import
```

Why `--no-import?` This builds the container but doesn't add it to BeeAI yet. You want to push it to a registry first so others can use it.

**Step 2: Push to Container Registry**

Push your container to a registry (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.):

```bash
# Tag for your registry
docker tag my-agent:1.0.0 ghcr.io/username/my-agent:1.0.0

# Push to registry  
docker push ghcr.io/username/my-agent:1.0.0
```

Why push to a registry?
- **Sharing**: Others can install your agent with `beeai add ghcr.io/username/my-agent:1.0.0`
- **Production**: Deploy the same container image across different environments
- **CI/CD**: Automated builds can push to registries
- **Versioning**: Tag different versions (`:1.0.0`, `:1.1.0`, `:latest`)

**Step 3: Add to BeeAI Platform**

Now install your agent from the registry:

```bash
beeai add ghcr.io/username/my-agent:1.0.0
```

<Note>
**CI/CD Integration**: The starter template includes a complete GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds. Check out [.github/workflows/build-agent.yaml](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform-agent-starter/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-agent.yaml) in your project.
