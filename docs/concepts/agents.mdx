# Understanding Agents

Agents are at the core of the BeeAI platform. They represent autonomous components that can perform specific tasks, process information, or interact with users. This document explains agent concepts, their structure, and how they function within the BeeAI ecosystem.

## What are Agents?

In BeeAI, an agent is a self-contained module that:

- Implements the [Agent Communication Protocol](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/) (ACP)
- Has clearly defined inputs and outputs
- Performs a specific function or set of related functions
- Can operate independently or as part of a composition
- Is packaged as a Docker container

Conceptually, agents can be thought of as specialized "workers" that excel at specific tasks, from simple operations like text summarization to complex workflows like research, content generation, or data analysis.

## Agent Architecture

Every agent in BeeAI has these common components:

### 1. Agent Interface

The interface defines how the agent communicates with the outside world through:

- **Input Schema**: Defines the expected input format
- **Output Schema**: Specifies the structure of the agent's response
- **Metadata**: Information about the agent's capabilities, requirements, and usage

### 2. Agent Logic

The core functionality of the agent, which can include:

- Processing input data
- Making API calls to external services
- Using language models for text generation
- Utilizing specialized tools (search, weather, etc.)
- Performing computations or data analysis

### 3. Container Runtime

All agents run in containerized environments (Docker), ensuring:

- Consistent execution across different platforms
- Isolation from the host system and other agents
- Dependency management
- Scalability and reproducibility

## Agent Types

BeeAI supports various types of agents:

### By Interaction Pattern

- **Chat Agents**: Conversational agents designed for back-and-forth interaction with users
- **Hands-Off Agents**: Single-purpose agents that process input and produce output without intermediate steps
- **Custom UI Agents**: Agents with specialized interfaces for specific use cases

### By Framework

- **BeeAI Framework Agents**: Built using the official [BeeAI Framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework)
- **Community Framework Agents**: Built with frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, etc.
- **Custom Agents**: An agent implementation that implements ACP protocol built with potentialy any framework

### By Purpose

- **Tool Agents**: Perform specific operations like search, data processing, or code generation
- **Assistant Agents**: Provide conversational help and information to users
- **Composer Agents**: Coordinate the execution of multiple agents (like sequential_workflow)
- **Domain-Specific Agents**: Specialized for particular fields like legal, medical, or financial tasks

## Agent Metadata

Agent metadata provides essential information about an agent, including:

- **Name**: Unique identifier for the agent
- **Description**: Brief summary of the agent's purpose
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanation of how the agent works
- **Framework**: The framework or technology used to build the agent
- **Examples**: Sample usage and expected outputs
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration options for the agent
- **UI Type**: How the agent should be presented in the user interface
- **Links**: References to source code, documentation, etc.

Here's an example of agent metadata:

```yaml
name: chat
description: AI-powered conversational system with memory and tools
metadata:
  programming_language: Python
  license: Apache 2.0
  framework: BeeAI
  documentation: |
    The agent is an AI-powered conversational system designed to process user messages,
    maintain context, and generate intelligent responses...
  ui:
    type: chat
    user_greeting: How can I help you?
  examples:
    cli:
      - command: 'beeai run chat "What is the weather like in Paris?"'
        name: With tools
        description: Run agent with tools.
        output: The current temperature in Paris is 12°C with partly cloudy skies.
  env:
    - name: LLM_MODEL
      description: Model to use from the specified OpenAI-compatible API.
    - name: LLM_API_BASE
      description: Base URL for OpenAI-compatible API endpoint
    - name: LLM_API_KEY
      description: API key for OpenAI-compatible API endpoint
```

## Standardized Agent Interfaces

BeeAI provides standardized UI patterns for agent interaction:

### Chat Interface

Designed for conversational agents:
- Full conversation history and context
- Message-by-message interaction
- Streaming responses
- Suitable for assistants and complex interaction flows

### Hands-Off Interface

For single-input, single-output agents:
- One input field for the user request
- Processes the request and returns a complete response
- No intermediate interaction
- Suitable for transformation, generation, or analysis tasks

### Custom Interfaces

For specialized agent requirements:
- JSON input interface for complex data structures
- Custom visualizations
- Application-specific UI elements

## Agent Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a BeeAI agent includes these stages:

1. **Discovery**: Agents are found in the registry or from custom sources
2. **Installation**: Agents are downloaded and installed locally
3. **Configuration**: Required environment variables are set
4. **Execution**: The agent runs in response to user requests
5. **Updating**: Agents are updated to newer versions as needed
6. **Removal**: Agents can be uninstalled when no longer needed

## Agent Management

BeeAI provides tools for managing agents:

- **Listing Agents**: `beeai list` shows all available agents
- **Installing**: `beeai install <name>` installs an agent
- **Running**: `beeai run <name> [input]` executes an agent
- **Inspecting**: `beeai info <name>` shows agent details
- **Viewing Logs**: `beeai logs <name>` displays agent logs
- **Removing**: `beeai remove <name>` uninstalls an agent

## Creating Agents

To create your own agent:

1. Choose a development framework (BeeAI Framework, LangChain, etc.)
2. Implement the agent logic following the ACP standard
3. Package the agent as a Docker container
4. Test the agent locally
5. Share the agent with others

{
  "input": [
    {
      "parts": [
        {
          "content": "Research renewable energy trends",
          "role": "user"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Structured Input:**
```json
{
  "input": [
    {
      "parts": [
        {
          "content": "Analyze the attached dataset",
          "role": "user"
        },
        {
          "content": "base64-encoded-csv-data",
          "content_type": "text/csv",
          "role": "user"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Multi-modal Input:**
```json
{
  "input": [
    {
      "parts": [
        {
          "content": "Describe this image and suggest improvements",
          "role": "user"
        },
        {
          "content": "base64-encoded-image-data",
          "content_type": "image/png",
          "role": "user"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Output Formats

Agents produce various types of output:

**Text Responses:**
```json
{
  "type": "message_part",
  "content": "Based on my research, renewable energy adoption..."
}
```

**File Artifacts:**
```json
{
  "type": "artifact",
  "name": "research_report.pdf",
  "content": "base64-encoded-pdf-content",
  "content_type": "application/pdf",
  "content_encoding": "base64"
}
```

**Progress Updates:**
```json
{
  "type": "generic",
  "agent_name": "research-assistant",
  "status": "gathering_sources",
  "progress": 0.3,
  "message": "Found 15 relevant sources, analyzing content..."
}
```

## Agent Development Best Practices

### Design Principles

**Single Responsibility:**
- Each agent should have a clear, focused purpose
- Avoid creating "do-everything" agents
- Compose complex workflows from specialized agents

**User-Centric Design:**
- Clear, helpful descriptions and examples
- Intuitive input expectations
- Meaningful progress indicators
- Comprehensive error messages

**Reliability:**
- Graceful error handling
- Appropriate timeouts
- Resource usage optimization
- Consistent output quality

### Performance Optimization

**Efficient Resource Usage:**
```python
# Good: Stream responses for long-running tasks
async def long_running_agent(input_text):
    yield MessagePartEvent("Starting analysis...")
    
    for step in analysis_steps:
        result = await process_step(step)
        yield MessagePartEvent(f"Completed {step}: {result}")
    
    yield MessagePartEvent("Analysis complete!")

# Bad: Return everything at once after long processing
def blocking_agent(input_text):
    # Long processing with no feedback
    result = expensive_operation(input_text)
    return result  # User waits with no progress indication
```

**Memory Management:**
```python
# Good: Process data in chunks
def process_large_dataset(data):
    for chunk in chunk_data(data, size=1000):
        yield process_chunk(chunk)

# Bad: Load everything into memory
def process_all_at_once(data):
    return [process_item(item) for item in data]  # Memory intensive
```

### Error Handling

**User-Friendly Errors:**
```python
try:
    result = call_external_api()
except APIKeyError:
    raise ValueError(
        "API key is missing or invalid. "
        "Please check your LLM_API_KEY environment variable."
    )
except RateLimitError:
    raise ValueError(
        "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again in a few minutes."
    )
except NetworkError:
    raise ValueError(
        "Network connection failed. Please check your internet connection."
    )
```

## Agent Security

### Input Validation

**Sanitize Inputs:**
```python
def validate_input(input_text):
    # Check for malicious content
    if contains_injection_patterns(input_text):
        raise ValueError("Input contains potentially malicious content")
    
    # Limit input size
    if len(input_text) > MAX_INPUT_SIZE:
        raise ValueError(f"Input too large. Maximum size: {MAX_INPUT_SIZE}")
    
    return sanitize_text(input_text)
```

### Secret Management

**Never Hardcode Secrets:**
```python
# Good: Use environment variables
api_key = os.getenv("LLM_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("LLM_API_KEY environment variable required")

# Bad: Hardcoded secrets
api_key = "sk-hardcoded-key-here"  # Security risk!
```

### Container Security

**Run as Non-Root User:**
```dockerfile
# Create non-root user
RUN useradd -m -u 1000 agent

# Switch to non-root user
USER agent

# Set secure permissions
RUN chmod 755 /app
```

## Agent Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks

Every agent implements health endpoints:

```python
@app.get("/ping")
async def health_check():
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "dependencies": {
            "llm_provider": await check_llm_connection(),
            "database": await check_database_connection()
        }
    }
```

### Metrics Collection

**Performance Metrics:**
- Request/response times
- Success/failure rates
- Resource utilization
- Concurrent request handling

**Business Metrics:**
- Popular agent features
- User satisfaction indicators
- Task completion rates
- Error patterns and causes

### Logging

**Structured Logging:**
```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

def process_request(input_text):
    logger.info(
        "processing_request",
        input_length=len(input_text),
        agent_version="1.0.0"
    )
    
    try:
        result = process(input_text)
        logger.info(
            "request_completed",
            output_length=len(result),
            processing_time=elapsed_time
        )
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(
            "request_failed",
            error_type=type(e).__name__,
            error_message=str(e)
        )
        raise
```
