## What is BeeAI Platform?

**BeeAI Platform** is the first open-source platform built on the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/), an open standard designed to enable smooth communication between AI agents, no matter what framework they're built on. Hosted by the **Linux Foundation**, BeeAI platform is driven by open governance and community collaboration.

With ACP at its core, BeeAI platform makes it easy to:
- **Discover** agents built with different frameworks through our growing catalog
- **Run** agents instantly with your preferred LLM provider through our intuitive UI and CLI interfaces, creating a frictionless "try experience" that just works
- **Orchestrate** multiple specialized agents into powerful workflows using our growing catalog of meta-agents (like sequential-workflow)
