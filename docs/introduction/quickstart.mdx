<Steps>
<Step title="Install BeeAI">

Install the BeeAI CLI using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (on Linux you'll also need [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/#linux)):

```sh
uv tool install beeai-cli
```

</Step>
<Step title="Start the BeeAI platform">

```sh
beeai platform start
```

</Step>
<Step title="Configure the LLM provider"> 
   
```sh
beeai env setup
```

</Step>
<Step title="Use the CLI">

Get familiar with the core commands:

```sh
# List all available agents
beeai list

# Run an agent interactively
beeai run chat

# Run an agent with direct input
beeai run chat "Hello! How are you?"

# Get agent details and parameters
beeai info chat

# View all CLI options
beeai --help
```

</Step>
<Step title="Launch the web interface">

```sh
beeai ui
```

<Note>
    The web UI is intentionally simplified for end-users who need basic agent interactions without CLI complexity. Think of the web UI as a deployment target for your agents, not your primary development environment.
