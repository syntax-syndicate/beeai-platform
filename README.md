**BeeAI** is an open-source platform that makes it easy to **discover**, **run**, and **share** AI agents across frameworks. Built on the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/) and hosted by the **Linux Foundation**, BeeAI bridges the gap between different agent ecosystems.

## The Problem BeeAI Solves

Teams trying to operationalize AI agents face three critical challenges:

- **Framework Fragmentation:** Different agent frameworks create silos and duplicated efforts
- **Deployment Complexity:** Each agent requires its own setup, limiting scalability
- **Discovery Challenges:** No central hub exists for finding and using available agents

BeeAI provides a standardized platform to discover, run, and share agents from any framework - for both individuals and teams.

## 👩‍💻 For Individual Developers

BeeAI makes it easy to experiment with agent capabilities on your own machine:

- 🧪 **Try agents** instantly from the community catalog without complex setup
- 📦 Use **standard interfaces** that create consistent user experiences
- 🛠️ **Package existing agents** from any framework using standardized containers
- 🌍 **Share agents** with others through a consistent web interface

## 👥 For Teams

As you scale from personal experimentation to team adoption, BeeAI grows with you:

- 🌐 **Deploy a centralized BeeAI instance** that the entire team can access
- 📚 Create a **team catalog** where developers publish and end users discover agents
- 🧰 **Standardize agent interfaces** for consistent user experiences
- 🔐 **Centrally manage** LLM connections to control costs and access

## Key Features

| Feature | How It Works | Business Value |
| :------ | :----------- | :------------- |
| **Agent Catalog** | One BeeAI platform serves your entire team | Everyone works from the same system with unified management |
| **Framework Agnostic** | BeeAI implements the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) to standardize agent interfaces regardless of how they're built | Developers use their preferred tools while maintaining compatibility |
| **Containerized Agents** | Each agent runs in its own container with defined resource limits | Better performance, improved security, and efficient resource usage |
| **Consistent Interfaces** | Predictable agent interactions | Learn once, use everywhere |
| **Agent Discovery** | All agents appear in a searchable catalog with capability details | End users easily find agents and developers see usage patterns |
| **LLM Provider Flexibility** | Connect to any LLM provider | Use the best model for each task and easily switch providers |

## Quickstart

> [!TIP]
> This is the short version. See the [installation guide](https://docs.beeai.dev/introduction/installation) for detailed instructions.

1. **Install** the BeeAI CLI using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (on Linux you'll also need [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/#linux)):

```sh
uv tool install beeai-cli
```

2. **Start** the BeeAI platform:

```sh
beeai platform start
```

3. **Configure** the LLM provider:

```sh
beeai env setup
```

4. **Use** the CLI:

```sh
# List all available agents
beeai list

# Run an agent interactively
beeai run chat

# Run an agent with direct input
beeai run chat "Hello! How are you?"

# Get agent details and parameters
beeai info chat

# View all CLI options
beeai --help
```

5. **Launch** the web interface:

```sh
beeai ui
```

> [!NOTE]
> The web UI is intentionally simplified for end-users who need basic agent interactions without CLI complexity. Think of the web UI as a deployment target for your agents, not your primary development environment.
